* artificial intelligence - John McCarthy 1956 (invented Lisp)
* candidate solution
* category/target: Y values
* classifier (decision tree for example)
* classify
* cost
* decision tree: categorical or numerical.  Aim for the leaf node.
** classification tree: category
** regression tree: equation with a numerical value
** bottom up - builds a classifier
** top down (induction of decision trees) - divides the data
** decision tree split quality (look it up)
* deterministic approach
* domain knowledge - important input into heuristics.
* entropy - can be a heuristic.  Logarithmic.  If everything is identical, 0 entropy (coin flip).
* features: X values
* fitness
* heuristic - best guess (taking an increasing step)
* homogenous
* hyperparameters - parameters chosen in advance
* information gain - based against the baseline entropy (calculated using all data points)
* Iterative Dichotomiser 3 - decision tree by JR Quinlan, 1985.
* leaf node
* machine learning - Arthur Samuel 1959 (computer checkers)
* pivot - one element to quicksort around
* prune
* purity
* random forest - picking a best feature
* ruleset
* spirangle
* stochastic (search) - basically random
* stopping criteria - like in recursion
* supervised learning - uses training data
* training data
* Turtle - Python app originally in Logo (Seymore Papert)
